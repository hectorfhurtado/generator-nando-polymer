## First use case: Simple page project with no Sass

### Create a new project

Okay, I assume you have installed yeoman and this generator. Let's start creating a new folder:

	$ mkdir prueba && cd prueba
  
or, if you are working on Brackets, you can click on 'File -> New Project...'

### Create scaffolding with Yeoman

Type on your command line:

    $ yo nando-polymer

Yeoman appears and asks you some questions. For this project I'm not going to use Sass and I'm not going to use a server, so I leave a blank on this one.
